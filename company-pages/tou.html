          <h2>Terms of Use</h2>
          <p>These Terms of Use (“TOU”) provide the basic terms and conditions that govern each Owner’s access to and use of the Services (defined below) provided by Propaya or one of its affiliated entities (references to “Propaya” or its pronoun herein mean the Propaya-affiliated entity providing the applicable Service). Please carefully read these TOU before accessing or using any Service. These TOU may contain links to additional governing terms and conditions that are incorporated by reference and will apply depending on the Service(s) ordered.By accessing or using any Service(s), Owner acknowledges and agrees that it has read, understands, is bound by, and will comply with these TOU. Propaya may modify these TOU at any time without notice to Owner. Propaya will post the revised Service Terms at this website and update the “Updated” date at the top of these TOU. Propaya recommends that Owner reviews these TOU periodically for any changes. Owner’s continued access to or use of any Service(s) will constitute acceptance of the revised legally-binding TOU</p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <h3>1.    <strong>KEY TERMS</strong>‍</h3>
          <p>The following subsections define several of the key terms used throughout these TOU:</p>
          <p>1.    “Manager” means the entity that manages individual real estate properties (each a “Property” or “Site”) either as the owner (“Owner”) or as an agent of the Owner.</p>
          <p>2.    “Services” means the products and services,including software and related solutions, provided by Propaya through http://propaya.com .</p>
          <p>3.    “Authorized Users” are limited to (i) Manager’s,Owner’s, and their respective affiliated entities’ employees; and (ii)third-party consultants certified in writing by Propaya to access a Service on behalf of Manager or Owner (provided that Manager and Owner are responsible for each such Authorized User’s ongoing compliance with these TOU). No other third party may be considered an Authorized User unless expressly agreed in by Propaya.<br>d. “Output” means the tangible or intangible work product created by Propaya or otherwise generated through the Services, including through the exercise of the license rights granted to Propaya under these TOU.<br>e. “Agreement” means these TOU and any Propaya terms incorporated by reference herein.</p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <h3>2.    <strong>MANAGER AS AGENT OF OWNER</strong></h3>
          <p>1.    <strong>Manager and Owner</strong>: The license to access and use any Services is held by the applicable Owner for each Property using the Service. If Manager is signing up for the Services, but does not own the Property for which a Service is being purchased or licensed (that is, Manager is not also the Owner), then (i) Manager agrees to the terms of these TOU on behalf of the applicable Owner(s) in Manager’s capacity as such Owner’s authorized agent (and by doing so Manager commits the Owner to the terms of these TOU). To confirm this, Propaya must receive a representation from Manager (in Section 2.c.) affirming its agency authority. As a result,Propaya will have the right to hold Owner responsible if Manager defaults under these TOU.</p>
          <p>2.    <strong>Individual Agreement per Owner</strong>:If Manager signs up for Services covering multiple Properties and/or Owners,then this creates a unique Agreement (and thus a unique set of contractual obligations) between Propaya and each Owner for such Owner’s Property(ies).</p>
          <p>3.    <strong>Manager Representations</strong>: Each time Manager signs up for or accesses any Service(s) on behalf of an Owner,Manager is representing to Propaya that Manager (i) is either the Owner or the duly appointed agent of the Owner for each Property accessing any Service(s),and (ii) has the authority, either as the Owner or the duly appointed agent of the Owner, to:</p>
          <p>1.    sign up for the Service(s);</p>
          <p>2.    agree to the terms of the Agreement;</p>
          <p>3.    access and use the Service(s), on behalf of the Owner, for the applicable Property(ies); and</p>
          <p>4.    pay the invoices for all fees and charges associated with the Service(s) for each Property in accordance with the terms of the Agreement.</p>
          <p>4.    <strong>Recourse to Owner</strong>: Unless Manager has misrepresented its agency relationship with an Owner, Propaya will look solely to the Owner for payment of all fees and expenses associated with access to and use of the Services for the Owner’s applicable Property(ies).</p>
          <h3>‍</h3>
          <h3>3.    <strong>LICENSE TO THE SERVICES AND OUTPUT</strong></h3>
          <p>1.    <strong>License Grant</strong>: During the Term, Propaya grants to Owner a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license (the “License”) to permit Authorized Users to access and use (i) the Service(s) made accessible to Owner, and (ii) any Output from those Services.</p>
          <p>2.    <strong>License Restrictions</strong>: The License granted above is contingent on continued compliance with the following:</p>
          <p>1.    The Services and Output must be used in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and solely for Owner’s internal business operations.</p>
          <p>2.    Except to the extent expressly permitted by the terms of the Agreement, Owner may not</p>
          <p>1.    modify, create derivative works from,distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or sub-license the Services or Output;</p>
          <p>2.    use the Services or Output for service bureau or time-sharing purposes or in any other way allow third parties to exploit the Services or Output;</p>
          <p>1.    reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to discover any of the source code, proprietary processes, or algorithms associated with the Services or Output;</p>
          <p>2.    permit anyone other than Authorized Users to access or use the Services or Output for any purpose;</p>
          <p>3.    remove, alter or obfuscate any trademark, logo,copyright, or other proprietary notices associated with the Services or Output;</p>
          <p>4.    make any unauthorized use of Propaya’s brands(including its trademarks or service marks); or</p>
          <p>5.    place on any portion of the Services or Output,materials that are illegal, obscene, dangerous or libelous, or that violate,infringe or misappropriate any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, or other statutory or common law intellectual property right.</p>
          <p>3.    <strong>Registration Requirements</strong>: To register for any Services, Owner (or Manager on behalf of Owner) must provide certain information requested by Propaya (which may include the full legal name for Authorized Users, a valid email address and phone number for contact purposes, and other related information). Such information may be collected by Propaya using a third-party service, and Owner hereby authorizes Propaya to collect such information. Any such information collected is subject to Propaya’s Privacy Policy at <a href="https://propaya.com/privacy">https://propaya.com/privacy</a> , which is incorporated herein.</p>
          <p>4.    <strong>Access to Services</strong>: Propaya will provide user names and passwords to Manager or Owner as necessary to access the Services. Manager and Owner are responsible for (i) maintaining at least industry standard security and control over the user names and passwords to ensure that no unauthorized person may gain access to the Services, (ii)permitting only Authorized Users to access and use any Services, and (iii)notifying Propaya immediately if a user name or password is compromised. Propaya is not liable for any loss or misuse of Owner Data arising from unauthorized third-party access to the Services through any user name or password provided to Manager or Owner, except to the extent such unauthorized access is caused solely by Propaya’s gross negligence or willful misconduct.</p>
          <p>5.    <strong>Compliance by Authorized Users</strong>:Manager and Owner are responsible for ensuring that all Authorized Users comply with the terms and conditions of the Agreement.</p>
          <p>6.    <strong>Propaya’s Rights</strong>: Propaya retains all rights in and to the Services and Output that are not expressly granted to Owner in the Agreement.</p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <h3>4.    <strong>TERM AND TERMINATION</strong></h3>
          <p>1.    <strong>License Term</strong>: The initial term of each License (the “Initial License Term”) begins on the earlier of (i)Activation (defined as the first day that Owner Data for a Property is accessible through a Service, regardless of whether the Service is in production) or (ii) as specified in the ordering process, and continues for the term specified (monthly or annual). Following the Initial License Term, the License will automatically renew for the same (monthly or annual) terms (each,a “Renewal License Term” and, collectively with the Initial License Term, the“License Term”) unless either Propaya or Owner provides written notice of termination at least 30 days prior to the end of the then-current License Term.For annual License Terms, Owner has committed to purchase the Services for the full annual term, to be paid annually in advance. Owner may cancel the Services prior to expiration of the annual License Term without refund. Owner will pay all accrued but unpaid fees upon expiration of the License Term or termination of Services. The expiration or termination of a License for an Owner does not affect any License for any other Owner.</p>
          <p>2.    <strong>Termination</strong>: The License Term for a Service may be terminated early by a party if the other party breaches a material provision of the Agreement relating to such Service and fails to cure within 30 days after receiving written notice of the breach from the non-breaching party. Early termination will not (i) limit the non-breaching party from pursuing other available remedies, including injunctive relief, or (ii) relieve Owner of the obligation to pay fees owed under the Agreement. Propaya may terminate a free trial account at any time in its sole discretion.</p>
          <p>3.    <strong>Suspension</strong>: Propaya reserves the right to suspend access to all or portions of the Service(s) licensed by Owner, with or without prior notice, if Manager, Owner or any Authorized User(i) commits acts or omissions that compromise the security of a Service, (ii)permits unauthorized access to a Service or any Output, (iii) interferes with other users of a Service, or (iv) engages in harmful, inappropriate, or unlawful conduct relating to a Service. Propaya will inform Owner of the basis for any such suspension, minimize its scope as reasonably practicable, and reinstate access upon resolution of the underlying issue (if timely cured, as applicable).</p>
          <p>4.    <strong>Change in Property Ownership or Management</strong>: Propaya understands that Owners may sell or transfer management of Properties from time to time, and that the portfolio of Properties managed by Manager is subject to change. Propaya will not transfer any historical data relating to any such Property to the new Manager or Owner without receiving express written permission from the former Owner (or, in the event of a change in management only, from the existing Owner).</p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <h3>5.    <strong>CHARGES AND BILLING</strong></h3>
          <p>1.    <strong>Charges for Fees and Taxes</strong>:Except to the extent set forth in the payment terms for a Service, Propaya charges and collects non-refundable fees in advance (on a monthly or annual basis depending on the applicable License Term) for use of the Services. Propaya does not pro-rate or grant refunds or credits for any partial month or year of Services. All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and Owner is responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies or duties. Each invoice may include taxes, levies or duties that Propaya is required to collect by applicable taxing jurisdictions. Owner must provide Propaya with a valid credit card as a condition to subscribing to the Services. Propaya reserves the right to modify its fees and to introduce new charges at any time, upon at least 15 days’ prior notice to Manager or Owner,which notice may be provided by email or posted within the Propaya platform or application.</p>
          <p>2.    <strong>Valid Payment Method</strong>: Owner must maintain with Propaya a valid credit card on the Subscription Settings page of their Propaya account at all times. During the License Term for any Service, Owner authorizes Propaya to charge the payment method on file. This authorization remains valid until 30 days after termination or cancellation of such License Term, whereupon Propaya may charge Owner’s payment method for any outstanding charges as applicable.</p>
          <p>3.    <strong>Billing and Contact Information</strong>:Owner agrees to provide to Propaya and maintain complete and accurate billing and contact information. This information includes Owner’s legal name or company name, credit card and billing address, email address, name and telephone number of an authorized billing contact. Owner will update this information immediately upon any change. If such contact or billing information is determined to be false or fraudulent, then Propaya reserves the right to immediately suspend or terminate Owner’s access to any Services in addition to any other available legal remedies.</p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <h3>6.    <strong>PAYMENT</strong></h3>
          <p>1.    <strong>Payment Timing</strong>: Owner will pay invoiced amounts to Propaya within 30 days after the applicable invoice date,after which any such unpaid amounts will be considered past due. Owner will pay any tax (and related interest and penalties) imposed on Owner under applicable tax law relating to Owner’s access to or use of the Services. In order to encourage timely payment, Propaya reserves the right to charge interest on any invoiced amounts that are past due at a rate equal to the lesser of 1.5% per month or the greatest amount permitted by applicable law, calculated from the due date,as well as any expenses incurred to collect overdue amounts.</p>
          <p>2.    <strong>Remedies for Late Payment</strong>: Propaya reserves the right to impose a reconnection fee in the event Owner’s account access is suspended and thereafter reinstated. Owner agrees and acknowledges that Propaya has no obligation to retain Owner Data upon suspension or termination of a License and that such Owner Data may be irretrievably deleted if Owner’s account is 15 days or more delinquent.\</p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <h3>7.    <strong>REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES</strong></h3>
          <p>1.    <strong>Both Parties</strong>: Each party represents and warrants that (i) it has the full corporate right, power, and authority to enter into the Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder;(ii) it has taken all actions necessary to execute, deliver, and perform under the Agreement; and (iii) the execution of the Agreement, and performance hereof, does not violate any agreement to which it is a party or by which it is bound.</p>
          <p>2.    <strong>Owner</strong>: Owner will comply with all applicable local, state, national and foreign laws, treaties and regulations in connection with its use of any Services, including Applicable InfoSec Laws (defined below).</p>
          <p>3.    <strong>Propaya</strong>: Propaya represents and warrants to Owner that it will provide the Services in a good and workmanlike manner consistent with general industry standards. Such warranty is contingent on the Services being used in the manner and environment reasonably contemplated by the parties.</p>
          <p>‍</p>
          <h3>8.    <strong>DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</strong></h3>
          <p><strong>‍</strong>PROPAYA’S WARRANTY IS STATED IN SECTION 7 OF THESE TOU. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THESE TOU, (I) PROPAYA, ITS AGENTS AND ANY LICENSORS DO NOT MAKE ANY PROMISES OR WARRANTIES (EXPRESS OR IMPLIED) ABOUT THE SERVICES OR OUTPUT—INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY PROMISES OR WARRANTIES ABOUT THE FUNCTIONALITY, AVAILABILITY, RELIABILITY OR ERROR-FREE NATURE OF THE SERVICES OR OUTPUT, OR THAT THE SERVICES OR OUTPUT WILL SATISFY OWNER’S NEEDS; AND (II)THE SERVICES AND OUTPUT ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.</p>
          <p>‍</p>

For background, Owner Data associated with a particular Property is combined with other data of a sufficient type and quantity so that the Owner Data is irreversibly de-identified and anonymized in a manner that prevents a third party from reverse engineering the data to identify Owner or any individual person or particular Property, all in accordance with Applicable InfoSec Laws (as defined in Section 11.a.).</p>
          <p>5.    <strong>Retaining Owner Data</strong>: Propaya is not required to retain Owner Data after the expiration or termination of the License for the related Service(s) and may, in its discretion, delete such data after expiration or termination.</p>

Such security measures and procedures will be no less rigorous than are required under all federal and state information security laws, rules and regulations applicable to the provision of the Services (collectively “Applicable InfoSec Laws”). Further, as it relates to Owner Data that is Confidential Information, such security measures and procedures will be no less rigorous than the measures and procedures that Propaya uses to protect its own Confidential Information. Such program will contain physical, technical and administrative controls for the maintenance, transmittal and disposal of Owner Data provided under the Agreement, including access controls and password protected access, electronic barriers (e.g., firewalls or other similar barriers), encryption, secured storage of Owner Data (for hard copy and electronic documents), and appropriate policies and employee training.

          <p>3.    <strong>Security Breach</strong>: Except where prohibited by law, Propaya will inform Owner of any Security Breach promptly after confirmation of any such breach. “Security Breach” means any actual breach of Propaya’s platforms, networks, systems or servers that results in unauthorized access to or use of Owner Data.

As a limited exception, a party may disclose another party’s Confidential Information solely as necessary to comply with a subpoena or other legal request, so long as prompt prior notice (if legally permitted) is provided to the party whose Confidential Information is being disclosed.</p>
          <p>3.    <strong>Affiliates</strong>: As contemplated under the Agreement, a party may disclose the other party’s Confidential Information to its affiliates, but the disclosing party will be liable for its affiliates’ use and disclosure of any Confidential Information.</p>
          <p>4.    <strong>Return or Destruction of Confidential Information</strong>: The Recipient must use commercially reasonable efforts to protect against the unauthorized disclosure of the disclosing party’s Confidential Information. Upon written request, the Recipient will return to the disclosing party or destroy all copies of the disclosing party’s Confidential Information and will not in any manner use, convey, disclose or disseminate the Confidential Information (except (i) as otherwise expressly permitted under the Agreement or (ii) retained pursuant to the Recipient’s document retention policies and/or automated backup procedures in accordance with applicable law). Any retained Confidential Information remains subject to the confidentiality obligations in these TOU.</p>

If such changes cause the integration to no longer function as designed or intended (through no fault of Owner), and Owner chooses to not make such changes as are required to correct the problems, then Owner will have the right to terminate the license with respect to such API. If Owner’s use of an API causes the corruption of data within the Propaya platform, then (i)Propaya has no responsibility to fix the corrupted data, and (ii) Propaya may charge Owner for Propaya’s reasonable costs incurred to the extent Propaya chooses to fix the corrupted data.</p>
